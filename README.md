# CPE 487 Tetris Final Project

* Our project was to create a working Tetris video game with music that runs entirely and natively on the provided FPGA, the Nexys A7-100T.
* The project is designed to be stored and run natively on the Nexys A7-100T and requires the following external parts:
  * A VGA Monitor and cable to display the game from the VGA output on the FPGA.
  * A Pmod I2S DAC and speaker to output the game music.
      * This isn't required for the game to work, but there won't be any music without it.
